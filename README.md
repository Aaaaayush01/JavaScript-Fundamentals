# JavaScript Fundamentals

This repository contains my hands-on JavaScript practice while learning
core concepts such as variables, functions, arrays, and DOM manipulation.

The programs are implemented from scratch as part of structured learning
and are intended to demonstrate progressive understanding of JavaScript
fundamentals rather than production-ready applications.

## Topics Covered
- JavaScript basics (variables, functions, arrays, objects)
- DOM manipulation
- Event handling

## Mini Projects
- Rock Paper Scissors
- Todo List
- Shopping Cart

## Notes
This repository is for learning and practice purposes and reflects my
transition from Java to JavaScript and backend development.
